 This timer exhibits the ability to create a simple yet functioning virtual assistant.

* The avatar timer greets the user and then asks for their name.
* Next, the user is asked to input in minutes how long the timer should be set. (Optionally, the user may also include the type of event being timed, i.e.: a study timer, food timer, or workout timer.)
* Then the timer is displayed on the screen alongside the waiting avatar.
* At the end of the timed period, the avatar notifies the user with a custom message.

## Optimizations

I would like increase the UI to better emulate human interaction. I want to update the text to speech API to one that better resembles actual voice patterns and incorporate Unreal Engines MetaHuman software so that the avatar imitates human movement and expression.
